**Hi! I'm Stach Redeker ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a hardware engineer by heart, but sometimes I dabble around in software projects. My GitHub is the place where I show my work and aim to contribute to the open-source world. You can find some of my favourite projects below.

### Hardware
- [RTCwakeUpComputer](https://github.com/StachRedeker/RTCwakeUpComputer): A low-cost, hardware-based solution for turning a computer on and off at designated times, centered around the DS3231 RTC.
- [ArduinoMinimalCircuit](https://github.com/StachRedeker/ArduinoMinimalCircuit): Build a minimal ATmega328P circuit... so you don't need an Arduino anymore. And learn something about logic gates along the way.
- [WiFiThermometer](https://github.com/StachRedeker/WiFiThermometer): Transfer a temperature reading from an ESP8266 to another ESP8266 via the home router.
- [LightsGame](https://github.com/StachRedeker/LightsGame): A modern version of a classic (1972) game: 1D pong. But, most importantly: my first PCB!

### WordPress plugins
- [Automatic-Cache-Flusher-for-W3-Total-Cache](https://github.com/StachRedeker/Automatic-Cache-Flusher-for-W3-Total-Cache): W3 Total Cache recommends clearing your cache after a (plugin) update to prevent cache conflicts. This plugin flushes the W3 Total Cache automatically after a plugin update.
- [Minimal-Maintenance-Mode](https://github.com/StachRedeker/Minimal-Maintenance-Mode): The most minimalistic maintenance mode plugin for WordPress. Enable maintenance mode, show a custom message.

### Programs and tools
- [XML-screenshotter](https://github.com/StachRedeker/XML-screenshotter): Automatically generate screenshots from URLs found in an XML sitemap using the ScreenshotOne API in Python.

### Miscellaneous
- [ChatGPT-Turing-test](https://github.com/StachRedeker/ChatGPT-Turing-test): Can you discriminate between human and artificial intelligence? Test your skills using the unofficial ChatGPT Turing Test.
- [utMOD5-projectProcessor](https://github.com/StachRedeker/utMOD5-projectProcessor): JFEGS: a virtual processor for the DE1-SoC board, designed in VHDL. The processor ships with an application that is able to compute the Fibonacci sequence.
